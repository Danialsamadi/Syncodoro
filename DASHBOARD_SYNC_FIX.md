# Dashboard Sync Fix Documentation

## Problem

The Total Focus Time and other statistics displayed in the dashboard were showing different values between browsers when using the same account. For example:

- Browser 1: Total Focus Time = 46h 15m
- Browser 2: Total Focus Time = 33h 15m

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by the way dashboard statistics were calculated:

1. **Local Calculation**: Stats were calculated based on the local IndexedDB database in each browser.
2. **Partial Sync**: While sessions were synced between browsers, each browser might have an incomplete picture of all sessions.
3. **No Stats Sync**: The calculated statistics themselves were not synced between browsers.

## Solution

We've implemented a server-first approach for dashboard statistics:

1. **Created a Dashboard Sync Service**: A new service that fetches statistics directly from the Supabase server.
2. **Server-Side Calculation**: Statistics are now calculated on the server side using all available data.
3. **Consistent Data**: All browsers now show the same statistics because they're all pulling from the same source.
4. **Automatic Refresh**: Dashboard automatically refreshes after data sync operations.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Dashboard Sync Service

Created a new service (`dashboardSyncService.ts`) that:
- Fetches completed sessions directly from Supabase
- Calculates statistics on the server-side data
- Provides consistent statistics across all browsers

### 2. Modified Dashboard Page

Updated `DashboardPage.tsx` to:
- Use the server-side statistics as the primary source
- Fall back to local statistics only if server fetch fails
- Refresh when sync status changes to success

### 3. Enhanced Sync Service

Enhanced `syncService.ts` with:
- Event emitter system for sync completion
- Notification when sync operations complete

### 4. Updated Sync Context

Modified `SyncContext.tsx` to:
- Listen for sync completion events
- Update last sync time when sync completes

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Open Syncodoro in two different browsers
2. Log in with the same account in both browsers
3. Navigate to the Dashboard in both browsers
4. Verify that Total Focus Time and other statistics match
5. Complete a pomodoro session in one browser
6. Click the "Sync Data" button in both browsers
7. Verify that the statistics update and remain consistent

## Fallback Mechanism

If the server-side statistics fetch fails (e.g., due to network issues), the system will fall back to using local statistics. This ensures the dashboard remains functional even in offline scenarios.

## Benefits

- **Consistent Experience**: Users see the same statistics across all their devices
- **Accurate Data**: Statistics are calculated using the complete dataset from the server
- **Real-time Updates**: Dashboard refreshes automatically after sync operations
- **Resilient**: Falls back to local data when offline
